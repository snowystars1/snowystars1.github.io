	<p>
		This is a project I started working on during the Spring 2019 semester because I was interested in virtual reality technology. The game is intended to be a boss fight simulator with gameplay resembling a "bullet hell" environment where the player must be careful of their movements. Currently the game features the framework of a single boss as well as a movement system, and pick-up system which allows the character to pick up and wield certain items in their hands.
